# Complexity-Stability Analysis for Software Bug Prediction

This project explores the relationship between **software complexity metrics** and the **stability of feature selection algorithms** in the context of software defect prediction. It combines data from multiple open-source projects and evaluates how dataset-level complexity influences the consistency of feature selection across algorithms such as Chi2, Mutual Information, ReliefF, and Lasso.

## Project Steps

The project is organized into 17 structured steps:

### 1 Original Dataset
- CSV files from different open-source software projects are loaded.
- 10 key software metrics (e.g., WMC, CBO, LOC) and the target label `isExistBug` are filtered.
- All valid projects are combined into a single DataFrame (37,630 records).
- Bug rates per project are calculated.
- Outlier projects are detected using Z-scores.

### 2 Computation Dataset Complexity Metrics
- Using the `problexity` library, dataset complexity metrics are computed.
- Example metrics: `f1`, `density`, `clsCoef`, `score`, etc.
- Each project’s metrics are saved as separate CSV files.

### 3 Merge Complexity Metrics
- All complexity metric CSV files are merged into a single CSV file.

### 4 Feature Selection Stability Metrics
- FS is applied using four algorithms:
  - Chi-squared (Chi2)
  - Mutual Information
  - ReliefF
  - Lasso
- 30 iterations are performed for each FS method.
- Selected features are recorded for each iteration.
- Stability scores and confidence intervals (CI) are computed using binary selection matrices.

### 5 Merge Feature Selection Stability Metrics
- Stability scores are merged in a pivot table format.
- Projects are ordered according to a predefined strategy.
- Final stability scores for each FS method are saved in CSV format.

### 6 Merge Complexity Metrics and Stability Measures
- Merged using `project_name`.
- Final combined CSV is created.

### 7 Correlation Analysis between Complexity and Stability
- Pearson correlation is calculated between complexity metrics and FS stability scores.
- Heatmaps are created for visualization.
- Notable findings: `f4`, `lsc`, `t3`, and `clsCoef` show strong correlations with Lasso stability.

### 8 Feature Importance with Random Forest
- Random Forest models are trained for each project (30 iterations each).
- Average feature importance scores are calculated for the 10 metrics.
- Results are saved and visualized with bar plots.

## Filtered Dataset Analysis (Top 5 Features)

### 9 Feature Reduction
- Based on importance, a reduced feature set is created:
  - `WMC`, `CBO`, `RFC`, `LOC`, `NPM`

### 10 Re-computation of Complexity Metrics (Filtered)
- Complexity metrics are recalculated using the 5-feature dataset.

### 11 Merge Complexity Metrics (Filtered)
- All filtered complexity metrics are merged into a single CSV file.

### 12 FS Stability Metrics (Filtered)
- Stability scores are recalculated (K = 2) for the reduced dataset using 30 iterations.

### 13 Merge FS Stability (Filtered)
- Merged into a pivot format for all filtered projects.

### 14 Merge Complexity and Stability (Filtered)
- Final combined CSV is created for reduced feature set.

### 15 Correlation Analysis (Filtered)
- Pearson correlation heatmaps generated.
- Strong associations observed between metrics like `f4`, `clsCoef`, `t2`, `t3` and FS methods like Lasso and ReliefF.

### 16 Correlation Analysis After Removing Outliers
- Outlier projects (`Promise_xalan27`, `Promise_log4j`) are excluded.
- Correlation results become more robust and aligned with literature.

## Pipeline Summary

### 1. Load & Prepare Data
- Load `.csv` files from open-source projects.
- Keep 9 metrics (e.g., `WMC`, `CBO`, `RFC`, etc.) + `isExistBug` label.
- Merge all datasets into one (37,630 records) and remove statistical outliers.

### 2. Compute Complexity Metrics
- Use `problexity` to compute 20+ dataset-level metrics like `f1`, `density`, `clsCoef`, `score`, etc.
- Save results per project and merge.

### 3. Feature Selection & Stability
- Apply FS using: `Chi2`, `Mutual Info`, `ReliefF`, `Lasso`.
- Repeat each algorithm 30 times per project.
- Measure **stability** using binary selection matrix → Nogueira Index.

### 4. Correlation Analysis
- Merge complexity and stability data.
- Compute Pearson correlations.
- Visualize via heatmaps.

### 5. Feature Importance
- Train `RandomForestClassifier` across 30 iterations per project.
- Compute average importance for all 10 features.
- Identify top 5 most impactful: `WMC`, `CBO`, `RFC`, `LOC`, `NPM`.

### 6. Filtered Dataset Analysis
- Redo steps 2–4 with reduced 5-feature datasets.
- Results become more interpretable and aligned with literature.
